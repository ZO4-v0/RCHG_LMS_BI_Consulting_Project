# üìä RCHG LMS Analytics Strategy & Predictive Performance Reporting for Rychtenshane‚ÄØCommunity‚ÄØHousing‚ÄØGroup 


## Project Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive analytics solution for **Rychtenshane Community Housing Group (RCHG)** to enhance their Learning Management System (LMS) strategy. As BI consultants, our team analyzed training data, built a data model, applied advanced statistical methods, and developed interactive dashboards in Power BI. The goal was to generate insights and predictive tools that support RCHG‚Äôs compliance tracking, learning engagement, and staff performance development.

Our solution enables RCHG to monitor course completion rates, detect engagement patterns, evaluate skill development across teams, and forecast future training outcomes using real historical data.

### üìàForecasting:

#### Predict training completions for next quarter
In this analysis, we modeled and forecasted the number of quarterly training completions using time series techniques. The goal was to understand historical trends and predict future completions to support planning and capacity-building efforts.
- Model Used: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
- Forecasted Quarter: Q3 2025 (2025-09-30)
- Predicted Completed Courses: 27.46

#### üîç Interpretation & Key Takeaways

- The SARIMA model was trained to forecast future training completions based on historical quarterly trends.
- It captured seasonal fluctuations effectively during 2023 and 2024, offering moderate prediction accuracy.
- In 2025, we observed unexpected surges in actual training completions, exceeding model predictions likely driven by new organizational policies or increased training mandates.
- Next Quarter Forecast: The SARIMA model predicts 27.46 completions for the upcoming quarter ending 2025-09-30.

### ‚è≥ Regression Analysis: Impact of Training Time and Frequency on Performance Scores


To evaluate the relationship between training engagement and employee performance, we performed a linear regression using:

- **DurationMinutes**: Total time (in minutes) an employee spent on completed trainings.
- **CourseFrequency**: Number of completed training courses per employee.

The **target variable** was the **Combined Performance Score**, calculated as the average of:
- Communication Skill Score
- Technical Efficiency Score
- Teamwork Score
- Normalized Course Score (scaled to a 0‚Äì5 range)

#### Regression Results

| Term                  | Coefficient |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Intercept             | 3.14        |
| DurationMinutes       | 0.0005      |
| CourseFrequency       | 0.0147      |

#### Interpretation

- The **positive coefficient** for `DurationMinutes` is 0.0005, meaning that for every additional minute spent in training, the combined performance score increases by 0.0005 points suggests that longer training durations are slightly associated with better performance outcomes.
- The **positive coefficient** for `CourseFrequency` is 0.0147, indicating that each additional course completed is associated with an increase of 0.0147 points indicates that employees completing more courses tend to score higher on performance metrics.
- Though the coefficients are small, the direction of influence is meaningful and can inform targeted training interventions.



#### Model Visualization

The following scatter plot compares actual vs predicted performance scores:

### üßë‚Äçüíª ANOVA Analysis: Compare mean skill scores across multiple departments to identify statistically significant performance disparities

We conducted ANOVA tests to assess whether the mean performance scores differ significantly across teams.

### ANOVA Results Summary

| Skill                      | F-statistic | P-value | Result                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| Communication             | 1.31        | 0.2554  | No significant difference              |
| Technical Efficiency      | 0.18        | 0.9688  | No significant difference              |
| Teamwork                  | 0.33        | 0.8974  | No significant difference              |
| **Overall Performance**   | 0.79        | 0.5560  | No significant difference across teams |

> **Conclusion**: No statistically significant differences were found between teams in any of the skill categories.
